problem:
1. (iphone chrome + safari) on first page load an attempt to scroll sees the page go blank. if the page is reloaded or orientation is tilted from portrait to landscape, scrolling is possible in either orientation. however, on first page load if a button that's in view is clicked the page responds appropriately.

2. (iphone chrome only) once ReactiveFormsModule was added to a card-over template (access by clicking 'get started' button), scrolling isn't possible in portrait orientation until flipped to landscape. this issue doesn't exist if the orientation of the phone begins in landscape.
