problem:
1. (iphone chrome + safari) on first page load an attempt to scroll sees the page go blank. if the page is reloaded scrolling is possible. however, on first page load if a button that's in view is clicked the page responds appropriately.

2. (iphone chrome only) once ReactiveFormsModule was added to a card-over template, scrolling isn't possible in portrait orientation until flipped to landscape. this issue doesn't exist if the orientation of the phone begins in landscape.
